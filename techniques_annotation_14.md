The ability to enter trance states is a prerequisite of most magical systems, particularly Shamanism. A good deal of a shaman’s training is concerned with cultivating the ability to enter trance states and control them, for it is in such states, that much of the shaman’s power resides. There are many routes into trance, and indeed, there are many different shades of trance. The aim of this series is to discuss some trance states, where possible giving practical techniques for entering them. At this point it may be appropriate to make a disclaimer - some routes into trance are dangerous - so if you try anything out, the responsibility is yours alone.

What is Trance?
A good question, that. In modern Western Society we tend to have very fixed ideas about what constitutes a trance state - we tend to think of someone who is passive, eyes closed & limp, or oblivious to their surroundings. We tend to think of hypnotised people (the word hypnosis derives from Hypnos - Greek god of sleep) as quiescent & awaiting instructions. Two incidents come to mind at this point. The first was many years ago, sitting in a circle watching a “sensitive” woman enter trance. It started normally enough, but she began to thrash about and scream - no one knew quite what to do, and some members of the group tried to restrain her in various ways. As it turned out, in her trance, the woman was struggling against a demon, and the attempted ministrations of the onlookers were hindering her performance. In the second incident, I found myself in a similar position. After participating in a completely botched-up ritual, I wished to leave the place where I was staying, but didn’t fancy wandering the streets at 3:am in the morning. So, finding a quiet room, I performed a shape-shifting exercise (I’ll go into the details of this in a while) and entered a fairly deep trance. Eventually, some of the people present decided that I was under “astral attack by demons” and forcibly brought me back - not a very pleasant experience, as you can imagine. The moral of these tales is that we tend to have very definite ideas about what people “do” in trance states, and when something happens outside this framework, it is easy to do the wrong thing. 

We tend to think of trance states as very definite & different to ‘normal’ consciousness. But ‘normal’ consciousness is very difficult to track down. We move in and out of different shades of trance all the time, from daydreams to the total absorption that occurs whilst performing any energetic physical activity - and both daydreaming and physical exertion are routes into Shamanic trance.

A problem that we acquire from our culture is that we tend to be very ‘head-oriented’ in our experience - caught up with the continual commentary of the inner dialogue, and the words & images of the Hyperreal. Our sense of being a stable personality is maintained by transactions, both real and imaginary, with others. Move somewhere isolated and the self becomes more malleable - another classical shamanic gambit for entering trance states. The personality we acquire sets the limits on what we can, and cannot do. Often, by entering trance states, whether intentionally or not, we can perform feats or tasks that are normally outside our normal repertoire. If the self-referential awareness is frozen by shock, or distracted, the body seems to take over, moving us out of the way of danger. We like to think of ourselves as being ‘in control’ of our bodies. This is in itself a problem, as ‘letting go’ and becoming disinhibited (especially in a group setting) is very difficult for some of us - letting it all hang out is generally frowned upon. In other cultures, however, disinhibition is sanctioned and is the mark of a successful event. Here’s Lucian’s description of a Priestess of Delphi entering trance: 

She went blundering frantically about the shrine, with the god mounted on the nape of her neck, knocking over the tripods that stood in her path. The hair rose on her scalp, and when she tossed her head the wreaths went flying over the bare floor....her mouth foamed frenziedly; she groaned, gasped, uttered weird sounds, and made the huge cave re-echo with her dismal shrieks. In the end, Apollo forced her to intelligible
speech. 

Entering trance is not always a pleasant experience, particularly trance states involving possession. The feeling that something else is using your limbs, & that your voice is not your own, is very odd. The natural tendency, especially for Westerners, is to resist the experience, even when the incoming spirit is a beneficient one. Often, people who are possessed have no memory or awareness of what happened to them. Shamans often resort to drugs, exertion or ritual to temporarily blot out the personality, making possession easier.

Dancing Gazing
Gyrating Fasting
Drumming Sleep Deprivation
Singing Sensory Deprivation
Chanting Sensory Overload
Hyperventilating Emotional Arousal
Pleasure Pain

Choose any of the above routes - pursued relentlessly enough, with determination and practice, you can use any of them to enter trance states. Shamanic group rituals are well-orchestrated uses of many of the above options. Only by repeatedly pushing yourself over the edge will you learn to override the tendency to jerk out of trance when you feel your control slipping. But the trance itself is the means, rather than the end - this should be some objective, such as entry into one of the innerworlds, possession by a spirit, or acts of will. Different shamanic cultures can sometimes be characterised by the dominant routes into trance. The nomadic tribes of the North American Plains used pain as a route into trance, demonstrating at the same time physical prowess; while the Kaula shamans of India enter trance via prolonged sexual ecstasy. Use of drugs to enter trance is, of course, an important part of shamanic activity, but I’ll go into that another time.

ほとんどの魔術体系、特にシャーマニズムにおいて、トランス状態に入る能力は不可欠である。シャーマンの訓練の多くは、トランス状態に入る能力とその制御法を身につけることに割かれている。というのもシャーマンの力の多くはこの状態にこそ宿るからである。トランス状態に至る道筋はいくつも存在し、またその状態も一様ではなく様々な段階がある。この章の目的は、いくつかのトランス状態を紹介し、その状態に入るための実践的な技法をできるだけ提供することである。一部のトランスへ状態の手法には危険なものがある。したがってもしこれらの手法を試すのであれば、あなた自身の責任において行ってほしい。

**〈トランスとは何か？〉**  
これは良い質問だ。現代西洋社会では、トランス状態というものに対して非常に固定的なイメージを持っている。多くの場合は、目を閉じてぐったりして、周りでなにが起こっているかがわからなくなってしまった人物を想像するだろう。催眠状態（hypnosis）という言葉はギリシア神話の眠りの神ヒュプノスに由来するが、そのため我々は、催眠状態にある人間というのは、受動的に指示を待っている存在だと考えがちである。

ここで思い出す出来事が二つある。ひとつは、ある「感受性の高い」女性がサークルの中でトランスに入った場面だった。最初は普通に見えたが、彼女は突然体を激しくのたうち回し、叫び始めた。誰もどうしていいかわからず、グループの何人かが彼女を押さえつけようとした。だが後になって分かったのは、彼女はトランス状態で悪霊と戦っていたのだ。介入しようとした人々の行為は、彼女の戦いを妨げていたことになる。

もう一つの出来事は私自身の体験である。完全に失敗した儀式のあと、私はそこを離れたくなった。しかし、午前3時のような時間帯に通りをさまようのも気が進まなかった。そこで静かな部屋を見つけ、シェイプシフティング（変身）ワークを行い、深いトランスに入った。ところが周囲の人間はその私の姿を見て、「アストラル攻撃を受けている」と勘違いして、私を力づくで元の状態に引き戻して戻してしまった。想像していただけると思うが、まったく不愉快な体験だった。これらの話の教訓から学べるのは、人々は、トランス状態で「すべきこと」については非常に限定的な観念を持っているということだ。その枠から外れる出来事が起きると、このような誤った対応をしやすい。

**〈トランスと通常の意識〉**  
我々はトランス状態を「通常の意識」とはまったく異なるものと捉えがちだが、そもそも「通常の意識」というもの自体を明確に区別するのは難しい。我々は日常的に、さまざまな段階のトランスを行き来している——白昼夢にふけるとき、激しい運動に完全に没入しているときなど、いずれもシャーマニック・トランスへの入口となっている。

文化的背景からくるもう一つの問題は、我々が非常に「頭でっかち」な体験の仕方に偏っていることである。内的対話や映像・言葉の洪水に囚われている。自己という安定した人格は、現実・想像の区別を問わず他者との関わりの中で維持されている。だから、孤独な場所へと身を移せば、他者との関係によって固められていた自己はやわらかくなり、変容の余地が生まれる——これもまた、古典的なシャーマニック・トランスへの一手法である。

我々の「人格」は、できることと、できないことの境界を知っている。だがトランス状態に入ることで（意図的であれ無意識であれ）、本来の能力の枠を超える行為が可能になることがある。ショックで自己認識が凍結されたときや、注意が逸らされたとき、身体が自動的に動き、危険から逃れるといったことが起こる。我々は「身体をコントロールすべきだ」と思いがちだが、それ自体が問題なのである。特にグループの中で「解放される」「抑制を捨てる」ことは非常に難しい。だが他の文化では、そうした解放こそが成功の証として受け入れられていることがある。

ここで、古代デルポイの巫女がトランスに入った様子をルキアノスが描写している。

> 「神が首筋に乗ったまま、彼女は神殿内を狂ったように突進し、行く手にあった三脚台をなぎ倒していった。頭髪は逆立ち、頭を振ると花冠が床に舞い落ちた……彼女の口からは泡が飛び、うめき声、喘ぎ声、奇妙な音が漏れ、巨大な洞窟がその不気味な悲鳴にこだました。最後にアポロンが彼女に明瞭な言葉を話させたのだった。」

**〈憑依のトランスとその難しさ〉**  
トランスに入ることは、必ずしも心地よい体験とは限らない。特に「憑依」を伴うトランスはそうだ。他者（精霊や存在）が自分の手足を動かし、自分の声でない声が口から出てくる——これは非常に奇妙な感覚である。特に西洋人は、たとえ好意的な精霊であっても、そうした体験を本能的に拒絶しようとする傾向がある。多くの場合、憑依された人間はその間の記憶を持たない。シャーマンはしばしば、人格を一時的に消すためにドラッグや肉体的な努力、儀式を用いる。

**〈トランスに入るための手段の例〉**  
- ダンス、回転、太鼓、歌唱、詠唱、過呼吸 <br>
- 凝視、断食、睡眠剥奪、感覚遮断、感覚過多 <br>
- 快楽、痛み、感情の昂り <br>

上記のどの方法でも、十分な覚悟と練習を重ねればトランス状態に入ることは可能である。シャーマニックなグループ儀式では、これらを統合的に活用することが多い。

重要なのは、トランス状態自体は、目的ではなくむしろ手段になりえるということである。その先にあるべきは、内的世界への旅であったり、精霊の憑依であったり、何らかの意思の行使である。文化によって、トランス状態への主要なルートも異なる。たとえば北米の遊牧民は「痛み」を通じてトランスに入ったが、インドのカウラ・シャーマンは「持続的な性的陶酔」を手段とする。ドラッグの使用については、別の章で触れることにしよう。

### 🐌 「知られざる呪術師」による注釈　(1/4)

- 「トランスに入る」とは、単に目を閉じてリラックスすることではない。「身体が勝手に動く」感覚は、知性主導の自己感から脱け出す体験でもある。ただし日本文化のように「羞恥」や「周囲の目」に敏感な環境では、グループ儀式で「自分を手放す」こと自体が大きなハードルになる。これはもはや魔術というより、演劇的憑依の領域に近い。
- 本文に挙げられた「技法の一覧」は、単なるカタログではない。ダンス、ドラム、過呼吸、感覚剥奪、快楽や痛みなど、それぞれ異なる神経系を経由して「別の意識」へと接続するルートである。身体というメディアは、想像以上に多様にプログラム可能なのだ。NLPのアンカリングやトリガリングの考え方とも接続可能である。
- 「トランス」とは何かを問う前に、「通常意識とは何か」自体が実は曖昧であることに気づくべきだ。私たちは「普段の自分」を一つの固定した状態と考えがちだが、実際には白昼夢や運動、音楽、仕事への没頭などを通じて、日常的に軽度の変性意識を行き来している。シャーマニック・トランスは、特別な何かではなく、連続する意識スペクトルの一部として捉えるべきだろう。

Why enter Trance states?
Here are some good reasons:
1) Knowledge (i.e. that which cannot be gained in other ways) - this ranges from asking auntie Freda what’s it like on the other side, to asking a specific question about herbs to a particular
healing spirit. This can sometimes involve journeying to particular parts of the innerworlds to consult with a particular entity.

2) Enhancement of Abilities Possession by a war-god enhances martial prowess, or temporary authority over other spirits. For example, I had a client who had a recurring throat problem. I examined her in a light ‘vision’ trance and saw a toad-like creature that had swelled itself up and lodged in her throat. No way was it going to come out willingly. My allies advised me (again in trance) that the only entity the spirit would take notice of was an even bigger toad, so we performed a healing ceremony during which I became possessed by a toad-spirit, in order to interact with the one in my clients’ throat.

3) Communal Ecstasy The shaman provides a very important task for tribe or community - mediating between the everyday world and the larger-than-life world of myth and communal lore. The shaman becomes, or allows others to become involved in sacred mythic participation. The shaman acts as the guide - navigating the secret paths of the communitys’ cosmology. This brings up one of the biggest stumbling blocks to assuming shamanic roles in our culture - the fact that Western society has an extremely complex pool of mythic images to draw upon. This is not to belittle the shamanistic innerworlds. For example, a Tamang Shaman of Tibet participates in a mythic world shared by other members of the community - its history, myth and accumulated stories - actualised and intensified by years of training, visions, and rites.

Contrast this with the mythic world available to someone in modern Britain - an island that has been for centuries a melting-pot of many different cultures, with the electronic arms of the videodrome bringing in information from all over the planet, across both distance and time. It is possible for someone to have a good academic grasp of Tamang shamanistic beliefs, not to mention SF, fantasy, mythology, upbringing and the myriad ways of expressing spiritual endeavours. Also, modern society has tended to hand over the realm of the mythic to professionals: therapists, entertainers, philosophers - and we are to a large extent, cut off from participation in the mythic world, except (for the most part), sanctioned and sanitised escape routes which support consensus reality even as they provide the illusion that they challenge it. Anyway, all this leads to a pretty complicated mythic life. Fortunately, some mythic images & processes, such as the Underworld Journey (again, I’ll deal with this one another time) are fairly universal. Others however, become ‘lost’ as people forget or garble the routes into experiencing/understanding them. We rely so much on ‘secondhand daylight’ - reading & watching other people’s experience, that the oral transmission of knowledge is comparitively rare. The first coven I was involved with set an good standard - whenever the priestess wanted to impart to me the ‘feel’ of magick, we would go out into the open - whether it was a park, moon-lit street or by the sea shore. Direct, physical experience, especially when accompanied by a guide who isn’t into fucking you over, is better than sitting indoors reading a book any day! Anyhow, I digress.

4) Connectivity This is concerned with making connections - finding links between different ideas and subjects; making a creative leap that brings on a flood of new ideas & enthusiasm. I often enter a trance state to overcome writer’s block - letting aragments of conversation, poetry or images slip across my inner eye. Something will well up from the inside, and ideas & connections leap up like iron filings onto a magnet.

5) Demonstration of Ability In our culture, you may be able to get away with impressing people as a shaman because you’ve plowed through the complete works of Kaledon Naddair (no mean feat!). Apprentice shamans however, are sometimes required to enter trance states as a demonstration of their prowess. It is quite common for spirits to test you by placing you under extreme psychic pressure, so that the experience becomes a compressed version of the underworld initiation. Some spirits, demons, & deities will do their best to drive you bananas, only yielding their wisdom when you have proved yourself equal to the task. The spirits of psychotropics are particularly prone to that kind of behaviour, but I’ll save that for another time. There are other good reasons for entering trance but I’ve forgotten them, so I’ll move on.
You can’t become a shaman in your bedsit, in isolation from anyone else, although periods of deliberate isolation are neccesary from time to time. Also, there aren’t many instructors in shamanism hanging about (not unless you commit yourself to an endless round of weekend workshops), so you will have to learn from everyone and everything. It’s important to learn to recognise the onset of changes in awareness, and explore all possible routes into trance. Learn to trust your own senses and your intuition, rather than the internal dialogue or what you think you “ought” to do.

なぜトランス状態に入るのか？それには次のような理由がある。

**1) 知識を得るため(他の方法では得られない類の)**  
たとえば「フリーダおばさん、あの世ってどんな感じなの？」と尋ねるようなことから、特定の薬草について、その癒しの精霊に教えてもらおうとするような知識を含む。ときには、内的世界の特定の領域を旅して、特定の存在と接触する、というような形を取ることもある。

**2) 能力を強化するため**  
戦の神を憑依させて戦闘力を高めるなどの方法で、他の精霊に対する一時的な支配権が得られることがある。たとえば私のクライアントのひとりは、喉の不調をひんぱんに訴えていた。軽い「視覚的」トランス状態で彼女を観察すると、膨れ上がったヒキガエルのような存在が喉に巣くっていた。それを無理やり追い出すのは難しかった。私の盟友たちが（これもトランス中に）教えてくれたのは、その霊に効力を持つのは「もっと大きなカエル」だけだということだった。そこで、私は自分がヒキガエルの精霊に憑依される儀式を行い、クライアントの喉にいる存在と交渉した。

**3) 共同的なエクスタシーを得るため**  
シャーマンは、部族やコミュニティにとって極めて重要な役割を担っている。日常世界と神話や共同記憶の巨大な世界との間を仲介する必要があるからだ。シャーマンは神話的儀式への参加者となり、他者をそこに導く。シャーマンは、コミュニティの神話宇宙の「秘密の経路」を案内するガイドなのだ。この文化的役割を担う上で最大の障害となるのは、西洋社会が持つあまりにも複雑で雑多な神話的なイメージである。

たとえばチベットのタマン・シャーマンは、長年の訓練や幻視、儀式を通じて培われた歴史や神話、語りを仲間たちと共有している。だが現代イギリスではどうか──島国でありながら何世紀も多文化が混ざり合い、ヴィデオドロームのような電子メディアが世界中の情報を時間も空間も超えて流し込んでいる。タマン・シャーマニズムを学問として学ぶことはできても、それと同時にSFやファンタジー、神話、教育、その他さまざまな精神的な表現を同時に取り込んでしまう。さらに神話領域の世界は、セラピスト、芸術家、哲学者といった「専門家」の人々が外注するようになってしまった。

つまり、私たちは「神話的世界」と切り離されているのだ。せいぜい、逃避とカタルシスを提供する「現実に逆らっているようだが、実はそれを補強してしまっている」タイプの娯楽にアクセスするくらいだ。その結果、神話的な人生というのは、きわめて複雑な状況にある。

幸い、「冥界への旅」のように比較的普遍的な神話もある。しかし、他のものは忘れられたり、入り口が混乱したりしている。今日では「他人の昼間の光（＝間接体験）」にばかり頼っていて、口伝による知識が伝達されることはきわめて稀になった。

最初に私が参加したコヴン（魔女集団）によい例がある。巫女が「魔術の実感」を伝えようとするときには、必ず屋外で行った。公園でも、月明かりの街でも、海岸でもよかった。本物のガイドが隣にいて、直接的な身体的体験を共有していた──これは本を読むだけより、何倍も価値があった。少し脱線してしまったかな。

**4) つながり（Connectivity）を得るため**  
異なる概念や、対象のあいだにリンクを見つけ出して、新たなアイデアや熱意の奔流を生み出す。私は、スランプ（＝書けない状態）を抜けたいときと思うと、よくトランスに入る。断片的な会話、詩、映像が、内なる視野を横切るのをただ見守るのだ。すると何かが内側から湧き上がってくる。そして、磁石に吸い寄せられる鉄粉のようにアイデアやつながりが浮かび上がる。

**5) 能力を実証するため**  
現代の文化においては、たとえばカレドン・ナッデアの著作をすべて読破したといえば、シャーマンとして人を感心させることができるかもしれない。しかし修行中のシャーマンは、トランス状態に到達できることを、実地で示さねばならないことがある。精霊たちはしばしば、極度の精神的プレッシャーを与えてくる。これは「冥界イニシエーション」の圧縮版とも言えるものだ。いくつかの霊や神は、こちらを狂わせようとしてくる──その試練を乗り越えたときに、ようやく知恵を授けてくれる。幻覚性物質の霊たちは、特にその傾向が強い（この話はまた別の機会にしよう）。

他にもトランスに入る理由はあるが、今は思い出せない。なので次に進もう。

ひとつ言っておく。誰とも関わらず、自室に引きこもったままシャーマンにはなれない。意図的な孤独の時期は必要だとしても、それは例外である。部屋を出て、週末ワークショップなどで出会わなければ、シャーマニズムの教師に出会うこともほとんどない。だからこそ、あらゆるもの、あらゆる人から学ぶべきなのだ。意識の変化の兆しを読み取って、それに気づく技術を身につけるのだ。すべてのトランス状態になれる方法を試すこと。内的な対話や「こうすべきだ」という思考よりも、もっと自分自身の感覚と直感を信じること。

### 🐌 「知られざる呪術師」による注釈　(2/4)

- この節で語られる目的の多くは、魔術における「意図の明確化」や「精神の明晰化」と同じ意味を持つ。変性意識状態（altered state of consciousness, ASC）とは「儀式」と同じく手段であって、目的ではない。
- グラント・モリスンは『Invisibles』の企画書を書ききあげ、シジル魔術を起爆させるためにニュージーランドに行き、バンジージャンプで落下する途中にシジルを投げつけた。その後のこの作品による彼の成功は有名である。
- 「他者の体験を読むだけでは不十分」という実地性の強調は、現代のスピリチュアル啓発書やSNSで消費される知識の交換やマウント合戦に対する批判とも言える。この辺りの批判はスザンナ・クラークの『ジョナサン・ストレンジとミスター・ノレル』にも見られる。

Dreams
Much instruction can be gained via dreaming. Prospective shamans may even be identified by virtue of the content of their dreams, and it is not unusual for people to meet their guides in dreams. We tend to think of dreams as a very personal aspect of our experience, so it is sometimes disconcerting when someone that we know appears in our dreams. In dreams, historical time is abolished, and distance is no object. We may witness events from the past, future, or alternative presents. Despite appearances, much of our dream content is controlled by external agencies. If you study Jung for long enough, you will have “Jungian” dreams. It can be far more rewarding to develop a personal dream-language, or avoid any rigid system of interpretation. I tend to find that prolonged magical activity of any sort will mold the contents of your dreams accordingly.

During the Shamanic Development Course run by Sheila Broun and myself in 1987, I had a dream which illustrates this process. we were preparing for a session on musical improvisation, and I had spent the afternoon making a set of claves. In the evening, I sallied forth to the pub and got hideously drunk. I was suprised to have a very clear dream in which I was approached by two spirits who said “we are the spirits of your claves, these (below) are our names which you will burn onto the wood with a hot wire and give us butter to eat.” Which of course, I did. This made the claves a bit ‘more’ than just two bits of cut down broom handle.

Dreams are a useful starting point for entering the innerworlds. It can be useful to induce prophetic dreams, or meetings with spirits so that you can discuss a particular problem. A friend of mine who makes incense and perfumes reports that she occasionally dreams of a unique smell, which on waking, she can then analyse and manufacture. The magical artist Austin Osman Spare wrote that he would sometimes awake to find himself standing in front of a finished picture, having drawn it in his sleep. 

If you’re going to get into dream-life seriously then it’s essential to keep a dream diary. Writing down your dreams helps you remember them, and is indispensable when you start to evolve your own dream-language. Here’s some practical exercises:

1) Dream Control<br>
The easiest way to begin this is to choose something that you want to dream about, and visualise it until you fall asleep. A mantric sigil is also useful, for example: 

I WANT TO DREAM OF THE MONKEY SPIRIT<br>
Knock out all repeating letters & compress<br>
I WAN ODREM FHK SPIR<br>
rearrange<br>
NAWI REMOD SPHRIK<br>

Constant repetition of this ‘mantra’ before sleep will eventually empty the mind of the associated intent, and it will stimulate the Deep Mind (i.e. the subconscious) to throw up the appropriate images in dream.

2) Group Dreams
Here, a group of people can attempt to dream of being present, in each others’ company in a real or imaginary place that all concerned are familiar with. Again, visualisation and mantra are useful in attempting this. The first step is to achieve a common perception of the dream, and then, later on, the group can perform willed acts. A group of us once attempted this using the M.C. Escher print, “Relativity”.

3) Lucid Dreams
Lucid dreams are characterised by the fact that in a lucid dream, you are aware that you are dreaming! Lucid dreams are also much easier to remember, and you are more able to act with intentionality, rather than just being a passive participant in the dreams’ events. One way of inducing lucid dreams is to strive to see your hands in your dreams, the ‘shock’ of which will allow you to enter the lucid state. I was once dreaming of my home town, with everything as it was about 10 years ago; until that is, I looked down at my feet & realised that I was wearing my goth boots - the incongruity of which allowed me to enter the lucid state, and, by projecting a symbol upon a nearby house doorway, I was able to enter one of the Innerworlds. It can be rewarding to try and approach dreaming from a non-western point of view, such as that of the Aborigines or the Senoi of Malaysia. Some anthropologists believe that the Senoi dream psychology is the source of the tranquility of their lives.When first contacted by Westerners in the 1930’s, the Senoi had had no violent crime or conflicts within their community for between 200300 years.

**夢について**  
夢からは、多くの教えを学ぶことができる。将来シャーマンとなるべき人間は、その夢の内容によって選ばれることもある。夢の中で自らのガイドに出会うという話も珍しくない。我々は夢を非常に個人的な経験とみなす傾向があるため、知っている誰かが夢に現れると戸惑うことがある。夢の中では「歴史的な時間」は消え去り、距離も意味をなさなくなる。過去、未来、あるいは別の現在の出来事を見ることもできる。

見かけに反して、夢の内容の多くは外部の力によって左右されている。たとえばユングを長く学んでいると、「ユング的な夢」を見るようになる。それよりも、個人に合わせて夢を理解する方法を発展させるほうが有益で、外から学んだ知識で、固定的な解釈に陥ってしまうのは避けるべきだろう。私自身の経験では、どの体系であれ、魔術的な活動を長期間続けていると、夢の内容にはその影響が現れる。

1987年、シーラ・ブラウンと私が共同で行った「シャーマニック・ディベロップメント・コース」の際、まさにその現象どおりの夢を見た。我々は即興音楽のセッションの準備をしており、私は午後をかけてクラベス（一種の打楽器）を作っていた。夜になってパブへ行き、ひどく酔っ払って帰宅。ところがその夜、非常に鮮明な夢を見た。そこに現れたのはふたりの精霊で、「われらはお前のクラベスの精霊である。これがわれらの名だ。木に焼きごてで名を刻み、バターを供えよ」と言うのである。もちろん、私はその通りにした。それによって、そのクラベスは単なる木の棒以上のものとなった。

夢は内的世界への入口として非常に有用である。予知夢や霊的存在との対話を通じて、特定の問題に対処するためのヒントを得ることもできる。香や香水を製作する友人は、ときおり夢の中で「まだ存在しない香り」を体験し、それを目覚めてから分析・再現することがあるという。魔術的な芸術家オースティン・オスマン・スペアは、自分が眠っている間に絵を完成させ、目覚めたときには作品の前に立っていたことが何度もあると語っている。

夢の世界を本格的に探究したいなら、夢日記をつけることが不可欠である。夢を書き留めることは記憶を助け、個人的な夢の言語を進化させるうえで不可欠な手がかりとなる。以下にいくつかの実践的な方法を紹介する。

**1）夢のコントロール**  
まず、夢で見たいことを選び、それを思い描きながら眠りにつくのが最も簡単な方法である。マントラ的なシジル（印章）も有効である。たとえば：<br>

I WANT TO DREAM OF THE MONKEY SPIRIT<br>
↓（重複文字を取り除き、圧縮）<br>
I WAN ODREM FHK SPIR<br>
↓（再構成）<br>
NAWI REMOD SPHRIK<br>

このマントラを就寝前に繰り返し唱えることで、意図が意識から消えてゆき、深層意識（いわゆる「潜在意識」）に届くようになる。その結果として、適切な夢のイメージが立ち現れることがある。

**2）グループ・ドリーム**  
これは複数人で取り組む実験である。メンバー全員が現実の、あるいは想像上の共有された場所で、互いに夢の中で出会うことを目指す。これにも、視覚化とマントラが有効である。最初の目標は「夢の中で同じ場所にいる」という共通認識を得ること。その後、より意図的な行動に取り組む。私たちがかつて試した例では、M.C.エッシャーの版画「相対性」を共通イメージとして用いた。

**3）明晰夢（Lucid Dreams）**  
明晰夢とは、夢の中で自分が夢を見ていると自覚している状態を指す。明晰夢は通常の夢より記憶に残りやすく、夢の中で意図的に行動できるのが特徴である。明晰夢を誘発する一つの方法は、「夢の中で自分の手を見るよう努める」ことだ。その「衝撃」によって、夢の中での自覚が促される。

私がかつて見た夢では、10年前のままの故郷の町を歩いていた。しかしふと足元を見ると、自分がゴス・ブーツを履いていた。その違和感から私は明晰状態に入り、近くの家の扉に象徴を投影することで内的世界への扉を開くことができた。

夢については、アボリジニやマレーシアのセノイ族といった非西洋的視点から取り組んでみるのも興味深い。ある人類学者によれば、セノイ族の夢の心理学こそが、彼らの驚くべき平穏な社会の秘密であったという。1930年代に西洋人が初めて接触した際、セノイ族の社会には200年から300年もの間、暴力的犯罪や内部抗争の記録がなかったとされている。

### 🐌 「知られざる呪術師」による注釈　(3/4)

- 夢は「内的世界」への最初の鍵である。シャーマニズムにおいて、夢は単なる睡眠中の副産物ではなく、精霊・先祖・無意識との通路とみなされる。とりわけ予知夢や夢の中での出会いは、個人的なメッセージとして重視される。現代のオカルティストの中にも、夢を実践の中核に据える者は多い。

- 象徴の重要性においては、一般的な意味よりも個人的な文脈のほうが優先される。たとえば、幼少期にホラー映画で灰皿を凶器として見てしまった人は、ナイフよりも灰皿のほうを「危険なもの」として認識するようになっている可能性がある。

- 夢の実践は「日記」から始まる。明晰夢や予知夢、共同夢など、夢を通じた探求を本格化させるには、まず「記録」することが不可欠である。書き残すことで記憶が定着し、象徴の繰り返しやテーマの変化を観察することができる。最初は断片しか思い出せなくても、続けることで夢の記憶力は確実に伸びていき、より豊かな内的探求が可能になる。

Shape-Shifting
This is a very common exercise - taking on the form of an animal to gain (temporarily), an ability or quality associated with it. Some sports psychologists tell athletes to pick a particular animal and visualise themselves as it during warm-up exercises -which is more or less what the shaman does, except that the shaman is more likely to use animal skins, masks, drugs, postural and vocal mimicking as aids. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn called this exercise ‘Assuming the God-forms’, whereby the practitioner used a variety of props to ‘assume’ the form of a particular mythic figure, uniting themselves with it until they took on the power associated with that figure. This can be worked towards as a group game, whereby people pick an animal and mimick its behaviour. Shamans tend to have particular favourites - in some Central American tribes, the words for shaman and jaguar are the same. The shamans of the Jivaro people, who practice headhunting and head-shrinking, assume the forms of giant tarantulas. Even forms of martial arts can be related to animals - the Crane, Serpent and Panther being three Eastern forms.

Shape-shifting is also used for innerworld exploration, both in trance vision and dreams. You could start, for example, by casting your vision forth in the form of a cat to stalk the city streets at night, and work from everyday animals and pets, towards mythological and bizarre composite entities. A friend once cured herself of a spider phobia by deliberately cultivating the spider as her power animal, using the very fear and revulsion (emotional arousal) to propel her into trance. Visualisation alone is the weakest route into shape-shifting. As a general rule, it seems that the more intensely physical the method of trance induction, the more intense the level of trance - and hence the more ‘real’ the experience. When the toad-spirit wore my body, I found that I couldn’t walk or oppose my thumbs, & that I salivated copiously. Maya Deren, whilst researching Voodoo rites in the 1940’s, found that she became possessed on several occasions, and once ‘woke’ to find that not only had she participated in the proceedings, but that she had led the rite! She describes her feelings of becoming possessed:

“My skull is a drum; each great beat drives that leg, like the point of a stake, into the ground. The singing is at my very ear, inside my head. This sound will drown me! “Why don’t they stop! Why don’t they stop!” I cannot wrench the leg free. I am caught in this cylinder, this well of sound. There is nothing anywhere except this. There is no way out. The white darkness moves up the veins of my leg like a swift tide rising, rising; it is a great force which I cannot sustain or contain, which will surely burst my skin. “Mercy” I scream within me. I hear it echoed by the voices, shrill and unearthly; “Erzulie!” The bright darkness floods up through my body, reaches my head, engulfs me. I am sucked down and exploded at once. That is all”

While possession is quite common in shamanic cultures - it is fairly rare in Western Magick, though actors often report that they become so involved with their roles that they ‘become’ that character on stage. It is a kind of trance that allows us to do things that, normally, we are not ‘allowed’ to do - either by others, or our acquired sense of our own limitations. It is the spirit which is responsible, not the person. Accounts of possession can at first seem terrifying or violent, but in the culture where possession is accepted, that behaviour is sanctioned and expected. The spirits are known by the group, and their habits and behaviour known to most of the human participants. When someone is entered by a spirit, this becomes apparent by their altered posture, gestures, facial expressions and voice. As soon as one person enters trance, it becomes easier for others to do so as well.

Innerworld Exploration
The centre of the shaman’s cosmology is the axis mundi - the pole, ladder, or world-tree, which is the shaman’s access point to the different innerworlds of the mythic cosmology. It seems reasonable to assume that the Qabalistic Tree of Life evolved from a shamanic world-tree. The crossroads is another axis mundi symbol, appearing in Celtic, Greek, and Haitian mythologies. The innerworlds are populated by hosts of spirits, demons & ancestors. Contact and knowledge of these entities is part of the shared totality of experience of a tribal society, mediated by the shaman. This is rarely the case in Western culture - there is a vast variety of innerworlds which may be explored. The Deep Mind is very receptive to suggestion (after all, that’s how we learn), and can clothe itself in any kind of images. There are numerous cases of skeptical westerners being stricken by the curses of shamans. One option for the would-be urban shaman is to allow the client to enter a trance, then act as a guide as they move through their innerworld, using empathy and open-ended questioning. I find this preferable to other options as it allows the client to arrive at their own solution, at the same time drawing on their own power- from-within to heal themselves. It seems, at times, that all that is being done is that one is creating the ‘space’ where someone can learn to heal themselves. The alternative is to take the problem into your own innerworld and ask an ally about it. More orthodox divination techniques should not be overlooked either. Critics of the Western approach to magick often point out that it can become too much of a head-trip, concerned with abstractions and mental constructs. Shamanism however, is intensely physical, often to the point of intense discomfiture. Shamanic magick often involves pain, disarrangement of the senses, delusions, hallucinations and states bordering on obsession and personality disintegration. It’s a lot of fun, really.

### 🇯🇵 ジャック・ユア・ボディ...（4/4）

**変身（Shape-Shifting）について**  
これは非常に一般的なエクササイズであり、動物の姿をとることで、その動物に結びついた能力や特質を一時的に得ることを目的としている。スポーツ心理学者の中には、アスリートに対してウォームアップ中に特定の動物を思い浮かべ、自分がその動物になったと想像するよう助言する者もいる。これはシャーマンが行うこととほとんど変わらない。ただし、シャーマンの方が、動物の皮や仮面、薬物、身体の姿勢、声の模倣といった道具を使用する傾向がある。黄金の夜明け団（Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn）では、これを「神の姿を取ること（Assuming the God-forms）」と呼び、修練者はさまざまな道具を用いて特定の神話的存在の姿をとって、その力と一体化するまで自己をその存在に同調させる。この技法は、集団で行うゲームとしても応用できる。参加者それぞれが動物を選び、その動作を模倣する。シャーマンには特定の「お気に入り」が存在することも多く、たとえば中南米の部族の中には、「シャーマン」と「ジャガー」が同義語になっている文化もある。首狩りと頭部縮小術で知られるヒバロ族のシャーマンは、巨大なタランチュラに変身するという。武術でさえ動物と結びつけられており、東洋の武術では鶴、蛇、豹などのスタイルが存在する。

変身はまた、内的世界の探求においても用いられる。これはトランス状態での幻視や夢の中で行われる。たとえば夜の都市を歩き回る猫の姿を視覚化し、その視点で探索を始め、そこから身近な動物、ペット、そして神話的・合成的な存在へと発展させていくことができる。ある友人は、クモに対する恐怖症を克服するため、クモを自分のパワーアニマルとして意図的に育てた。彼女はその嫌悪と恐怖（感情的興奮）をトランスへの入り口として利用したのだ。視覚化だけによる変身は、もっとも弱い方法である。一般的には、トランスを誘発する手段が、身体的に激しければ激しいほど、トランスの深度も深くなり、体験の「現実性」も高くなる。たとえば私の身体をヒキガエルの精霊が宿したとき、私は歩くことも、親指を他の指と対向させることもできなくなって、よだれが止まらなくなった。

1940年代にヴードゥー儀式を研究していたマヤ・デレンは、何度か憑依を経験し、あるときは儀式の最中に自分がリードしていたことを「目覚めて」知ったという。彼女は憑依についてこう記している：

>「私の頭蓋は太鼓であり、その一打ごとに脚が杭のように地面へと突き刺さる。歌声は耳元、いや頭の中で鳴り響く。この音に私は溺れてしまう！『やめて！ やめて！』脚は引き抜けない。私は音の井戸に閉じ込められている。そこにはそれ以外、何もない。抜け出す道はない。白い闇が私の脚の静脈を駆け上がるようにして迫ってくる。それはとてつもない力で、私の皮膚を裂いてしまいそうだ。『慈悲を！』私は心の中で叫ぶ。その叫びが声として反響する──甲高く、超自然的な声で──『エルズリー！』。明るい闇が体内を駆け上り、頭に達し、私を呑み込む。私は引き込まれ、同時に爆発した。それがすべてだった」

憑依はシャーマニズム文化では一般的だが、西洋魔術では比較的まれである。ただし俳優の中には、役にのめり込むあまり「その人物に憑依される」ことがあると報告する者もいる。これはある種のトランスであり、通常であれば「許されない」ことを、他者や自分自身の限界意識を越えて可能にする。責任は人間ではなく霊にあるという構造だ。憑依の体験は最初は恐ろしく、暴力的に見えるかもしれないが、憑依が認められている文化においては、その振る舞いはむしろ期待されたものであり、許容されている。霊たちは共同体に知られており、その性格や行動も参加者の多くが理解している。誰かが憑依状態に入ると、その姿勢、身振り、表情、声の変化によって周囲もそれと分かる。そしてひとたび誰かがトランスに入ると、他の人も入りやすくなる。

**内的世界の探求（Innerworld Exploration）について**  
シャーマンの宇宙観の中心には「アクシス・ムンディ（axis mundi）」──柱、はしご、世界樹──がある。これは神話的宇宙のさまざまな内的世界へのアクセス・ポイントである。カバラの「生命の樹（Tree of Life）」もまた、シャーマニズム的な世界樹に由来すると考えられている。十字路というモチーフもまたアクシス・ムンディの象徴であり、ケルト、ギリシア、ハイチなどの神話に登場する。内的世界には、精霊、悪霊、祖先霊などが無数に存在しており、部族社会においては、それらの存在との接触や知識の共有は、シャーマンを媒介として成される全体的な文化体験の一部となっている。しかし西洋文化ではそのような共有が希薄で、探索される内的世界も多種多様である。ディープマインド（深層意識）は暗示に非常に敏感であり、どのようなイメージにも姿を変えることができる。懐疑的な西洋人がシャーマンの呪いで本当に苦しんだという例も少なくない。

都市部に住むシャーマン志望者にとっての一つの方法は、クライアント自身をトランス状態に導き、その内的世界を探索する際のガイドとして寄り添うことである。共感的に、そして開かれた問いかけを通じてクライアントの自己治癒力を引き出すという点で、この方法は私には好ましい。多くの場合、やっていることは「誰かが自分で癒すための空間を作る」ことに他ならない。別の選択肢としては、その問題を自分自身の内的世界に持ち込み、協力者（アライ）に助言を求める方法もある。もちろん、より伝統的な占術も軽視すべきではない。

西洋の魔術に対してよくある批判の一つは、それがしばしば「頭でっかち」になりすぎるという点である。つまり、抽象的な理論や観念的構造に偏りすぎるのだ。それに対して、シャーマニズムは極めて身体的であり、ときに強烈な不快感を伴う。シャーマンの魔術には、痛み、感覚の錯乱、妄想、幻覚、強迫観念、自己崩壊の境界に至る状態がしばしば含まれる。簡単に結論をまとめれば──めちゃくちゃ面白い、といえるだろう。

### 🐌 「知られざる呪術師」による注釈　(4/4)

-「変身」と聞くと馬鹿げているように思えるかもしれないが、実際にはそうでもない。たとえば会議で目立ちたくないとき、「自分が透明になっている」と想像するだけで、その目的を達成しやすくなることがある。このような技法は、NLP（神経言語プログラミング）のトリガリングやアンカリングとも通じる。

-「憑依」は、演劇において俳優が役に没入する感覚とよく似ている。この観点から見ると、魔術とは「自己の輪郭を曖昧にし、別の存在に一時的に明け渡す」ための技法と捉えることができる。重要なのは、たとえコアの人格が豆粒ほどに小さくなっても、最後には自力で戻れる強さを持ち続けていることである。

-「内的世界」は、比喩や空想ではなく、身体的に“体験される”空間である。アクシス・ムンディ、生命の樹、十字路といった象徴は、ただの記号ではなく、登る・降りる・移動するという身体感覚と結びついている。これらの象徴を通じた旅の感覚を理解するには、内的地図を「考える」のではなく、「身体で感じる」ことが求められる。だからこそ、トランス技法は身体的なのである。
